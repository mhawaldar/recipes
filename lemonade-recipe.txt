Ingredients
  5 lbs lemons
  2 cups water
  2 cups sugar

Instructions
  1. Cut lemons in half. Juice each lemon through a strainer into a large measuring cup. Keep juicing until you have 2 cups of lemon juice.
  2. Pour water into a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in sugar. Continue cooking over heat until sugar is dissolved and liquid looks clear again.
  3. Combine sugar solution with lemon juice. This is a lemonade concentrate. When ready to serve, add water to taste.
